## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- 2GB RAM minimum
- 1GB disk space

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**
   ```bash
   # If using git
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd eduinsights
   
   # Or simply ensure all files are in a single directory
   ```

2. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The system will automatically:
   - Install required dependencies
   - Generate sample educational data (500 students, 25 teachers)
   - Train machine learning models
   - Run system tests
   - Start the dashboard server

3. **Access the dashboard**
   Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8050
   ```

### Manual Setup (if needed)

If automatic setup fails, you can set up manually:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate data and train models
python app.py setup

# Start dashboard
python dashboard.py
```
